In my first lesson on the topic of Marketing schemes I felt a bit confused at first, but as the lesson went on I began to understand it more and more. 

I have learnt a lot about how you can disassemble adverts and identifying different techniques on how to draw your audience in and make them want to buy your products.

I was also surprised to learn that media was not just the news or twitter. But as I came to grips with what media was I began to feel more confident in the lesson.

Although I feel like this is just the beginning and we can and that there is still a lot to learn about Marketing and target audience's.
