In this lesson we had discussions about what we were surprised to find out when we were researching for articles.  I was shocked by the fact that 40% of teens are involved in sexting. We then did an anonymous vote on 3 questions. These were, Have you been shown inappropriate imagery, have you searched for inappropriate imagery and have you met anyone who is sexting. Overall I found this lesson to be very interesting and I feel as though i learnt a lot in this lesson.
