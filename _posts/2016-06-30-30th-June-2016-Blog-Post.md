In today's lesson we were finally given our Micro:Bit to translate our code onto. However i didn't get the chance to test this feature of it, as the JavaScript program wasn't loading for me. This was due to the fact that cookies had been disabled on the website, meaning the program wouldn't run. In the second half of the lesson we discussed what we were scared of finding on the internet. Multiple answers were put forward from various groups but one of the most common answers was porn. For our homework we had to find two newspaper articles. One on revenge porn and the other on sexting.

Here is my article on revenge porn: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30308942](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30308942)

And here is the one about sexting: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35577506](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35577506)
