This lesson Opened my eyes to how much time we all really spend on our devices and wherever it is too much. But it also made me think about trying to find the balance between time with family and time with friends. I believe that making us think of different rules ourselves helped them to become fixed in our minds.

Overall I found this lesson to be very eye opening and I found That it had a theme of making the most out of life.
