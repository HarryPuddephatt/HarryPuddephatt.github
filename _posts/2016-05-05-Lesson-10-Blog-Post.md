This lesson involved a lot of trial and error, and also lots of it at home. We were trying to Code a sorting hat esc device for sorting the houses at challoners. We also watched a clip from Harry Potter, to introduce us to the concept of a sorting hat. It Took me an hour of homework time to finally work out how I could do it sucsessfully.
