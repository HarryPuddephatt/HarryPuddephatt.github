During this lesson, I learnt a lot about how to create a good presentation using various means of software. One Such was Prezzi which, after playing around with it a bit, opened my eyes up to the infinite amount of possibilities that could be achieved through this software. You could earn a raise, get a job or even start a company all through this software.

I am currently in the process of creating a presentation of my own which looks like it could be good. In this lesson i felt I learnt a lot about what I would like to do in the future and career posibilitys.
