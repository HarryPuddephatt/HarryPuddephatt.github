**I think that I learnt a lot of information on the good points and the bad points of social media. I think that it really made me open my eyes to how dangerous social media can be.**

**The story of breck bednar was also very scary to think about. I found it bad to think that anyone could just call you away and kill you. **

**However I also learnt about how positive social media can be and how it can change lives for the better**
