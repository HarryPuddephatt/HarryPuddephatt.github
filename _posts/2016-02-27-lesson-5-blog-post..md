Creating my identity map was a challenge, especially when we had to share it with the class. I was worried what my other classmates would think of me. However, at the end when i did the read the comments they were (mostly) good things. there was the the occasional "scruffy handwriting" but apart from that is was good. I think that all of the comments that i made were constructive. I think that my identity map made me think about how some people might post on social media about where they live or their family. I believe that these six lessons made me really think about the advantages and disadvantages of social media. It really made me open my eyes.
