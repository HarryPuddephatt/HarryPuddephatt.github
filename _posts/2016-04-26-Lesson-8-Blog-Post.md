I think that todays lesson helped me to understand what makes a good presentation. We looked at other people's prezzis and found good points, as well as some things to improve, about them. This greatly helps me as now i can go back to my prezi and i can improve upon it. It also helped that we were looking at presentations from people who are the same age as me as it turns out, they made a lot of the same mistakes as i had. Overall I found this lesson very interesting and helpful for my presentation.
