In this lesson we started to learn how to code with things called Micro Bits. They are a BBC Project to help children learn to code as it will be a big job in the future. I learnt how to code a dice onto it. I Made something myself, it was an animation of a man doing a cartwheel. You can activate this by shaking your device. However, our Micro Bits hadn't arrived yet so we could not test out this feature, only see online simulations of it.
