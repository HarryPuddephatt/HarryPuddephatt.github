I found This lesson and the interactive video very interesting as when i left the lesson i found out that other classes had made different choices to us. However it also made me think about how you should think before you post things online.

As I was going around the CEOP website, i found out that if something ever did go wrong then i wouldn't be alone. Just looking at the website it seems that these people have real experience.

Overall I found this lesson very interesting and eye-opening.
